**NOTABENE FLOW RULES**

**PART 1 – OVERVIEW**

**Rule 100\. Purpose**

The Notabene Flow Services Agreement ("**Agreement**") is a bilateral agreement between Notabene and each individual Partner (referred to therein as a Customer). These Notabene Flow Rules (the "**Rules**"), which are fully incorporated by reference into the Agreement, are the published requirements, standards, and policies that create and govern a multi-lateral framework among all Partners in Notabene Flow. By accepting the Agreement and pursuant to it, Partners are bound to these Rules in their entirety as if each Partner had executed these Rules with every other Partner.

**Rule 101\. Order of Precedence**

In case of conflict or inconsistency, the order of precedence is, from highest to lowest: (a) the Agreement, (b) these Rules, and (c) the Documentation. Nothing in these Rules limits any of Notabene’s rights (including termination and suspension rights) under any Agreement.

**Rule 102\. Guiding Principles**

Notabene Flow is animated by the principles of neutrality, non-discrimination, and rigorous compliance. Notabene Flow balances these principles by implementing “open access subject to verification” (e.g., Rule 300\) and “enforcement via transparency” (e.g., Rule 701). Additionally, Notabene Flow is designed to transition gradually from centralized operation to distributed governance over time (Rules 201-204).

**Rule 103\.** **Definitions.**

"**Notabene Flow**" is a unified, open-loop payment coordination network that enables its Partners to conduct compliant digital asset transactions. Notabene Flow utilizes its standard Transaction Authorization Protocol (“**TAP**”) for secure pre-settlement authorization messages and coordination between participants and to exchange authorization, identity, compliance, and policy information among participants. Notabene Flow also enables unique payment links to coordinate transactions without requiring direct blockchain address exchange. 

“**Partner**” is a user of Notabene Flow that has executed an Agreement with Notabene and is accordingly bound by these Rules.

“**Network**” means the network infrastructure of Notabene Flow and all the Partners that participate in it.

“**End Users**” are users who have relationships with Partners to utilize their services. End Users do not directly access or interact with Notabene Flow, and, for clarity, only Partners interface with Notabene Flow or perform activities on or with Notabene Flow.

Any capitalized term in these Rules that is not defined herein has the definition set forth in the Agreement. 

**Rule 104\. Payouts and Pay-ins**

The **originator** is the End User sending funds (payor), and the **beneficiary** is the End User receiving funds (payee). In a **payout**, the End User of an Initiating Agent is an originator, and the End User of a Responding Agent is a beneficiary. In a **pay-in**, the End User of an Initiating Agent is a beneficiary, and the End User of a Responding Agent is an originator.

**Rule 105\. Partners and Agent Roles**

An “**Agent**” is any Partner entity that participates in Notabene Flow. Partners serve in one or more of the following “**Agent Roles**”:

1) Initiating Agent: Initiates transactions on behalf of End Users that are payment originators (payors) for payouts/push payments or beneficiaries (payees) for pay-ins/pull payments.  
     
2) Responding Agent: Responds to transaction requests on behalf of End Users that are payment originators (payors) for pay-ins or beneficiaries (payees) for payouts.   
     
3) Infrastructure Provider: Provides technical services to other Agents and does not hold direct End User relationships. Services provided include, but are not limited to: 

   o	Custodial services \- secure storage and management of digital assets; 

   o	Multi-Party Computation wallet APIs \- programmatic blockchain interaction; 

   o	Liquidity provision \- currency conversion and cross-chain operations; and 

   o	Orchestration services \- on-ramp/off-ramp, fiat-to-crypto conversion.

   

**Rule 106\. Non-Exclusivity**

Agent Roles are non-exclusive. Each Partner may serve as an Initiating Agent, Responding Agent, and/or Infrastructure Provider in a single transaction or in multiple transactions, subject to the applicable terms for each Agent Role.

**Rule 107\. Obligations of Each Agent Role**

1\. Initiating Agents must:

1) Allocates and distributes Transaction Fees;  
2) Create and manage payment requests with complete transaction details;  
3) Provide settlement assets or settlement addresses for payouts;  
4) Own the primary business relationship with its End Users; and  
5) Perform current KYC/AML and sanctions compliance on its End Users in accordance with Applicable Law.

2\. Responding Agents must:

1) Obtain proper End User authorization for all transactions;  
2) Select settlement methods from those supported an the Initiating Agent;  
3) Provide settlement assets or settlement addresses for pay-ins;   
4) Own the primary business relationship with its End Users;  
5) Perform current KYC/AML and sanctions compliance on its End Users in accordance with Applicable Law.

   

3\. Infrastructure Providers must:

1) Perform delegated technical functions on behalf of other Agents;  
2) Maintain institutional-grade security and audit capabilities;   
3) Meet the security and performance standards specified in the Documentation and these Rules; and  
4) Not maintain direct relationships with End Users; and  
5) Manages and fulfills its internal compliance obligations.

**Rule 108\. Notice and Communications**

As referenced throughout these Rules, notices and communications are in writing via email, and where Partners are required to (or elect to) submit documents or information to Notabene, they must do so via email. Notabene’s email is [flow@notabene.id](mailto:flow@notabene.id), and each Partner’s email is that which it recorded in the System or otherwise provided to Notabene (for example, in the contracting process). 

**PART 2 – UPDATING THE RULES**

**Rule 200\.** **Rule Revisions**

As operator of Notabene Flow, Notabene may revise these Rules from time to time in its reasonable judgment. Notabene will provide thirty (30) days’ advance notice to Partners for material revisions. Each of these revisions will become effective on the 30th day following such notice (or at a later time that Notabene specifies in its notice). Notabene will provide prior notice for revisions that are required for compliance with Applicable Law (except in exigent circumstances, when notice will be provided as soon as practicable). These revisions will become effective immediately upon notice, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law. Each Partner will be bound by all revisions to these Rules.

**Rule 201\.** ***The remainder of this Part 2 is not binding and represents solely the intent of Notabene.***

**Rule 202\.** **The Consortium**

Notabene may designate the first fifteen (15) Partners that execute an Agreement as members of a consortium (each such Partner, a "**Member**" and collectively the "**Consortium**"). Notabene may add more Members in its sole discretion. When constituted, the Consortium would function as an advisory board that may provide strategic guidance on Network development and growth, develop recommendations and initiatives for Notabene Flow, and similar oversight and advice work. The foregoing would not be binding on Notabene Flow or Notabene.

**Rule 203\.** **Dynamic Legislating** 

Notabene intends to set a threshold transaction volume which, when achieved (but no earlier than October 2026), will trigger the go-live of a dynamic legislating system (the “**System**;” this go-live date is the “**Start Date**”). The System will enable and authorize the Consortium to propose revisions to the current Rules text, to discuss these revisions in an open forum, and to have recorded votes. All of this may be done via search capabilities, audit trails, or otherwise as Notabene determines in its sole judgment. The System may also be utilized (or exclusively utilized, if the Rules are so revised) for notice, communications, and submissions. 

2\. In advance of the Start Date, Notabene will revise these Rules, in accordance with Rule 200 (or any similar provision then in effect), to incorporate rules to govern the System. These rules may be substantially in the form of the attached Appendix or otherwise as Notabene reasonably deems appropriate. Notabene will also revise this Part 2 as necessary for internal consistency.             

3\. For the first six (6) months following the Start Date (“**Transition Period**”), Notabene would (i) maintain a veto right on any Member’s proposal to revise the Rules and (ii) continue to have authority to revise the Rules pursuant to Rule 200 (or any similar provision then in effect). Following this Transition Period, the Consortium would exercise primary governance authority, subject to these Rules and Notabene’s limited emergency or compliance authority. 

4\. Notabene intends to gradually transition to the Consortium not only legislative authority, but also enforcement authority. Following the Transition Period, the Rules may be revised to transfer enforcement responsibilities, including the investigation of reported violations and determination of outcomes (Rules 708-709), from Notabene to the Consortium. This enforcement transition would include a phase-in period during which Notabene would retain a veto right for Consortium determinations. 

**Rule 204\. Gradual Decentralization**

When certain Network milestones are achieved, but no sooner than 18 months after the Start Date, governance may gradually expand to allow all Partners to participate in dynamic legislating. At that time, the Consortium would revert to a primarily advisory role, while retaining a narrowly-tailored veto right (subject to the Partners’ override) and certain investigatory and other enforcement authority. This gradual decentralization (including the design of these milestones) would be implemented if authorized by, and subject to, the Rules then in effect. Milestones may include, for example, total number of Partners, transaction volume growth since the Start Date, and other indicators of growth or maturity.

**PART 3 – COMPLIANCE AND OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS**

**Rule 300\. Minimum Partner Eligibility Criteria**

To access Notabene Flow, each prospective Partner must satisfy the minimum eligibility criteria set forth below (“**Eligibility Criteria**”), as applicable:

A **“Security Incident**” is a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to systems, data, or cryptographic keys. Each Partner will notify Notabene and other impacted Partners without undue delay, and no later than forty-eight (48) hours after confirming a Security Incident. Partners will provide updates, cooperate in remediation, and support reasonable assessments or audits.

**Rule 304\. Travel Rule Implementation**

1\. Partners must: 

1) Comply with the Documentation pertaining to jurisdiction-specific Travel Rule requirements at [https://intercom-help.eu/helpnotabene/en/collections/714921-jurisdictional-requirements](https://intercom-help.eu/helpnotabene/en/collections/714921-jurisdictional-requirements)  
2) Validate Notabene Flow's implementation as applicable to Partners' regulatory obligations

4) Promptly notify Notabene of legal or regulatory changes requiring system-level modifications  
5) Promptly forward Travel Rule messages to other entities within their corporate group if the legal entity was incorrectly identified by the originator.

2\. All Travel Rule data exchanges must:

1) Use TAP messaging with IVMS-101 compatible data fields  
2) Include complete originator and beneficiary identifying information  
3) Validate transaction amounts against jurisdiction-specific thresholds  
4) Maintain tamper-evident audit trails

3\. Partners must respond to Travel Rule messages within timeframes required by applicable regulations or, if not specified, within 24 hours.

4\. Incomplete, inaccurate, or dummy data constitutes breach of obligations to Partners who rely on such data for regulatory compliance. 

5\. Partners receiving incomplete data may reject transactions or request clarification.

**Rule 305\. Mandatory Rejection of Transactions**

Partners must refuse transactions involving (a) sanctioned persons or jurisdictions, and (b) non- compliance with FATF Travel Rule requirements and implementing regulations in applicable jurisdictions.

**Rule 306\. Continuing Obligations.**

Partners must continuously:

1) Comply with their respective Agreements, these Rules, and Applicable Law, and adhere to the Documentation;   
2) Maintain satisfaction of the Eligibility Criteria and promptly notify or update Notabene of any change resulting in non-satisfaction of the Eligibility Criteria or any other relevant material change as provided in the Agreement or these Rules;  
3) Implement and maintain security and risk controls; conduct sanctions screening and fraud prevention; adhere to operational and compliance requirements for transaction processing; and  
4) Check that the Travel Rule features in Notabene Flow are set up correctly for each Partner’s legal requirements. If a Partner believes anything is wrong or if Applicable Law changes, such Partner will notify Notabene promptly. A Partner will promptly request if it requires a new country or region added to Notabene Flow for Travel Rule compliance. 

**Rule 307\. Network Architecture** 

1\. Partners must integrate with and maintain technical compatibility with Notabene Flow and must complete end-to-end integration tests per the Documentation. 

2\. All transactions in Notabene Flow follow authorization-before-settlement principles. No settlement address may be disclosed or settlement executed until all required authorizations are obtained through TAP.

3\. All Partners must use TAP for authorization messaging. Each Partner controls its unique identifier for Network use.

**Rule 308\. Settlement Assets and Addresses**

1\. For payouts, Responding Agents must select settlement assets from the Initiating Agent's supported asset list. For pay-ins, Initiating Agents must select settlement assets from the Responding Agent's supported asset list. Settlement addresses must be provided only after complete authorization. 

2\. Partners must use standardized identifier formats specified in Documentation for blockchain assets, blockchain account addresses, blockchain networks, and fiat payment accounts. Partners may only share settlement addresses controlled by their organization. Partners must not provide false ownership attestations or addresses they do not control. 

3\. Partners providing settlement addresses must ensure addresses are: actively monitored, able to receive the selected funds or assets, properly formatted for the specified blockchain network, compliant with sanctions requirements, not involved with sanctioned protocols or services, and accessible through standard procedures. Partners must maintain backup access mechanisms in case of primary access failure. 

4\. Partners must maintain operational procedures to monitor settlement addresses for incoming transactions, confirm receipt within reasonable timeframes, and notify counterparties promptly of access issues.

**Rule 309\. Change System Management**

1\. Partners must provide advance notice to counterparties of material system changes that may affect coordination capabilities. API endpoint changes require minimum 7 days’ notice, protocol or integration changes require 14 days’ notice, and operational changes require 14 days’ notice.

2\. Emergency changes for critical security vulnerabilities, compliance requirements, or operational failures may be implemented immediately with notification within 2 hours and an explanation of why advance notice was not feasible.

3\. Partners must maintain reasonable backward compatibility during transitions, including maintaining old API endpoints for 30 days after deployment and supporting previous protocol versions. 

**Rule 310\. Error Disclosure and Correction**

1\. Partners discovering errors in their data, processes, systems, or communications that may affect other Partners or transactions must notify affected Partners within 24 hours. The notification must explain the error clearly, describe its potential impact, and propose specific remediation steps. Errors requiring disclosure include incorrect Travel Rule data, authorization mistakes, settlement address errors, system failures causing delays, data breaches, and compliance failures implicating other Partners.

2\. Critical errors affecting compliance, security, or settlement must be remediated within 48 hours or Partners must provide interim mitigation measures. Partners bear the costs of remediating their own errors.

**Rule 311\. Professional Communication**

All Partner communications conducted through or relating to the Network must be professional, respectful, and conducted in good faith. Partners must respond timely to communications and respect confidentiality obligations. Partners will not engage in offensive, abusive, threatening, or discriminatory language, harassment or intimidation, knowingly false statements, public disparagement, or the like. 

**PART 4 – COMMERCIAL RULES**

**Rule 400\. Transaction Fee Framework**

1\. Transaction Fees are charged on transactions processed through Notabene Flow and distributed among participating Partners and Notabene, according to the fee structure and distribution formulas set forth in this Part 4\. An audit trail is created, and Partners must follow all technical and other requirements in the Documentation to effect distribution. 

2\. Transaction Fees are imposed on the Initiating Agent for each consummated transaction. The Responding Agent and Infrastructure Providers on the transaction receive a percentage of these Transaction Fees. The Initiating Agent is fully responsible for ensuring that there are sufficient funds for distribution to Responding Agents and Infrastructure Providers.

3\. For payouts, fees are additional to the originator's payment amount. For pay-ins, fees are discounted from the amount received by the beneficiary (merchant discount model).

4\. Transaction Fees will be set according to a schedule (taking into account maximum and minimum Transaction Fees) that is incorporated into Notabene Flow.

**Rule 401\. Distribution Formula for Standard Transactions**

For a transaction with N participating Partners (excluding the Initiating Agent), the distribution is calculated as follows:

1\. Notabene Share: percentage of total Transaction Fees as stated in \_\_\_\_

2\. Optional: In the absence of a smart contract, there is a Fee Custodian Share: 5% of total Transaction Fee.

3\. Transaction Fees for Distribution \= Transaction Fees (not including FX or liquidity provider fees) minus Notabene Share minus Fee Custodian Share

4\. Transaction Share \= Transaction Fees for Distribution / (N+2)

5\. Responding Agent and KYC Holder (owner of the customer record) receive 2x of the Transaction Share.

6\. All other participating Agents who are involved receive the Transaction Share for their role.

**Rule 402\. Transaction Fee Errors**

1\.  Transaction Fee calculations and distributions are final and binding on all Partners.

2\. However, if a Partner believes that Notabene made an error in calculating or distributing Transaction Fees, the Partner must report this alleged error to Notabene within 7 days of the distribution date (or expected distribution date). The report must specify the transactions affected and the nature of the alleged error (e.g., miscalculation, incorrect distribution, technical malfunction) and include supporting documentation. Notabene will investigate reported errors and, if an error is confirmed, will correct it in the next applicable distribution or process a corrective distribution. 

**Rule 403\. Effective Date of Revisions**

Any revisions to this Part 4 take effect consistent with Rule 200, except that changes to recurring payment arrangements take effect 90 days after approval. 

**Rule 404\. Other Obligations**

1\. Partners must pay Transaction Fees regardless of any separate bilateral obligations that may exist between any two Partners.

2\. Partners may have a separate obligation to pay fees to Notabene for use of Notabene Flow (Use Fees), which are separate and independent from Transaction Fees. 

3\. Partners are fully responsible to pay any “gas fees” that may be due for processing transactions on any blockchain.

**PART 5 – MULTI-LATERAL LIABILITY FRAMEWORK**

**Rule 500\. General**

Each Partner is an independent service provider. Partners are solely responsible for their own services, customers, and End User relationships. In addition, Partners are the authorized transmitters of funds, and they initiate, authorize, and manage transactions in Notabene Flow. 

The following liability provisions govern relationships among Partners who transact together through Notabene Flow, notwithstanding any separate bilateral agreements that any individual Partners may have with each other.

**Rule 501\.** **Standard of Care**

Each Partner will perform its obligations and provide services through Notabene Flow using commercially reasonable efforts and in accordance with industry standards applicable to its role and services.

**Rule 502\. Exclusion of Liability for Third-Party Acts**

No Partner is liable for acts, omissions, or failures of other Partners, Notabene, blockchain networks, or other third parties beyond the Partner's control.

**Rule 503\. Transaction Failure Liability** 

1\. In a payout, if an Initiating Agent fails to complete settlement after authorizing and obtaining authorization from a Responding Agent, the Initiating Agent is liable for Transaction Fees owed to all participating Agents as if the transaction had completed. 

2\. In a pay-in, if a Responding Agent fails to complete settlement after obtaining authorization from a Initiating Agent, the Responding Agent is liable for Transaction Fees owed to all participating Agents as if the transaction had completed.

3\. For purposes of this Rule, "complete settlement" means the Partner has (i) initiated the fund transfer on the agreed payment rail, and (ii) provided transaction confirmation through Notabene Flow.

**Rule 504\. Liability Related to End Users**

Partners are liable to their own End Users for service failures, but are not liable to other Partners' End Users absent a direct contractual relationship. Nothing in this Rule 504 limits a Partner's indemnification obligations under Rule 505\.

**Rule 505\.** **Mutual Indemnification**

1\. Each Partner agrees to defend and indemnify other Partners against third-party claims arising from:

1) The indemnifying Partner's fraud, willful misconduct, or gross negligence;  
2) The indemnifying Partner's violation of Applicable Law or these Rules;  
3) Claims by the indemnifying Partner's End Users, Excluded Services, or External Providers (as defined in the Agreement) against the indemnified Partner, except if:  
   1. the indemnified Partner has a direct contractual relationship with such End Users, Excluded Services, or External Providers, or   
   2. where such claims arise from the indemnified Partner's gross negligence, fraud, willful misconduct, or breach of these Rules.

2\. Each Partner will follow these procedures:

1) The indemnified Partner will provide prompt written notice of the claim (within 15 days, although notifying after this date does not waive any right to a defense and indemnity).  
2) The indemnified Partner will reasonably cooperate in the defense of the claim.  
3) The indemnifying Partner controls the defense.  
4) The indemnifying Party will not agree to any settlement that imposes obligations or liability on an indemnified Partner without the indemnified Party’s prior written consent.

**Rule 506\.** **Direct Damages Only**

Each Partner's liability to other Partners in connection with Notabene Flow transactions is limited to direct damages actually incurred. No Partner will be liable for consequential, indirect, special, exemplary, or punitive damages or for lost profits, lost revenue, or reputational harm.

**Rule 507\. Liability Cap to Any Other Partner**

Each Partner's aggregate liability to any other Partner for all claims arising from Notabene Flow transactions will not exceed the greater of: (i) fifty thousand U.S. dollars ($50,000 USD) or (ii) the total Transaction Fees earned by the liable Partner from transactions with the claimant Partner during the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.

**Rule 508\. Exceptions to Per-Partner Liability Cap**

The liability cap in Rule 507 does not apply to:

1) Partner’s fraud, willful misconduct, or gross negligence   
2) Indemnification obligations under Rule 505   
3) Partner’s security breach or confidentiality breach  
4) Violations of Applicable Law

**Rule 509\. Absolute Aggregate Cap to All Partners**

1\. Notwithstanding Rule 508, no Partner's aggregate liability to all Partners for all claims arising in any twelve (12) month period will exceed two million U.S. dollars (2,000,000 USD) (“**Absolute Cap**”), except for liability arising from sanctions violations or criminal conduct, which have no cap.

2\. If aggregate claims from multiple Partners exceed the Absolute Cap, the Partner’s total liability is limited to the Absolute Cap, and available funds will be allocated as follows: 

1) Indemnification obligations under Rule 505 are paid in full first;   
2) Remaining funds (if any) are allocated pro-rata among other claims based on each Partner's final judgment or settlement amount;   
3) If indemnification obligations under Rule 505 exceed the Absolute Cap, they are allocated pro-rata among claimants. 

**Rule 510\. Survival** 

This Part 5, including all multi-lateral liability provisions, survives any Partner’s cessation of the use of Notabene Flow and/or the termination of any Partner's Agreement with Notabene. These provisions continue to govern any relationships arising from transactions conducted while the Partner was active in the Network.

**PART 6 – KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS**

**Rule 600\. General**

Notabene intends to measure and report key performance indicators (KPIs) for every Partner, as applicable. This Part 6 and rules in Part 7 relating to KPIs will go into effect only when Notabene provides notice that KPIs are live on Notabene Flow.

**Rule 601\. Global KPIs**

A straight-through processing rate will be measured for every Partner. This rate must be \> 95% for transactions where all parties meet compliance requirements and provide required information.

Fraudulent activity is expected to be recorded for every Partner. 

**Rule 602\. KPIs for Initiating Agents Only**

1\. For Initiating Agents acting in payouts, the following KPIs will be measured:

(a) Payout creation to authorization request: \< 2 minutes for 95% of transactions  
(b) Settlement execution: \> 95% of authorized payouts settled within 1 hour  
(c) Payment link validity: \> 98% maintained for minimum validity periods  
(d) Travel Rule response: \> 95% answered within 24 hours  
(e) Premature cancellation rate: \< 5% after Responding Agent engagement  
(f) Transaction failure rate: \< 1% over rolling 30-day period

2\. For Initiating Agents acting in pay-ins, the following KPIs will be measured:

(a) Settlement receipt confirmation: \< 2 minutes for 95% of transactions  
(b) Payment link validity: \> 98% maintained for minimum validity periods  
(c) Travel Rule response: \> 95% answered within 24 hours  
(d) Transaction failure rate: \< 1% over rolling 30-day period

**Rule 603\. KPIs for Responding Agents Only**

1\. For Responding Agents acting in payouts, the following KPIs will be measured:

(a) Authorization decision time: \< 4 minutes for 95% of transactions  
(b) Settlement address provision: \> 99% include valid addresses  
(c) Travel Rule data completeness: \> 95% with complete IVMS-101 data  
(d) Authorization completion rate: \> 90% receive decision versus timeout  
(e) Transaction failure rate: \< 1% over rolling 30-day period

2\. For Responding Agents acting in pay-ins, the following KPIs will be measured:

(a) Payment completion time: \< 4 minutes for 95% of transactions  
(b) Settlement execution: \> 95% executed within 2 minutes  
(c) Travel Rule data completeness: \> 95% with complete IVMS-101 data  
(d) Authorization decision time: \< 8 minutes for 95% of transactions  
(e) Transaction failure rate: \< 1% over rolling 30-day period

**Rule 604\. KPIs for Infrastructure Providers Only**

For all Infrastructure Providers, the following KPIs will be measured:

(a) System availability: \> 99.9% per calendar month  
(b) Response time: \< 500ms for 95% of message acknowledgments  
(c) Settlement address provision: \< 1 hour for 95% of transactions  
(d) Service completion rate: \> 99% successfully completed  
(e) Security incident rate: Zero critical incidents per calendar month  
(f) Infrastructure failure rate: \< 1% over rolling 30-day period

**Rule 605\. Transparency**

Notabene intends to provide every Partner with full access and transparency to the KPIs of every other Partner in Notabene Flow and to its own KPIs. This Rule cannot be revised, except by Notabene.

**PART 7 – ENFORCEMENT**

**Rule 700\. Enforcement Triggers.**

Notabene intends for enforcement to be triggered by continuous monitoring, manual monitoring, and peer reporting. This Part 7 will go into effect only when Notabene provides notice that enforcement mechanisms are live on Notabene Flow. 

1\. Continuous monitoring: 

Notabene Flow monitors transactions continuously to ensure that transactions settle and that Transaction Fees are paid. 

Notabene’s intent is to monitor the KPIs in Part 6 on a continuous basis for each Partner. 

2\. Manual monitoring: 

Partners must confirm their satisfaction of Eligibility Criteria once annually and, accordingly, will submit updated documentation (as provided in Rule 301\) on each anniversary of the effective date of their Agreement. If Notabene does not receive such documentation (to Notabene’s satisfaction, in its reasonable judgment) within thirty (30) days of this anniversary, Notabene will notify the Partner that this submission is overdue (“**Overdue Notice**”). 

3\. Peer reporting or Notabene’s independent identification: 

Enforcement is triggered if one Partner reports to Notabene, or if Notabene independently identifies, that another Partner: 

1) Does not satisfy the Eligibility Criteria at any time (e.g., regulatory license suspension) (“**Potential Non-Eligibility**”),   
2) Appears on a sanctions list (OFAC or equivalent),  
3) Commits fraud on Notabene Flow,  
4) Has experienced a security breach that poses an actual or reasonably suspected security threat to Notabene Flow, or  
5) Acts in a manner threatening the integrity of Notabene Flow.

Each of items (b) through (e) above is a “**Reportable Activity**.” Peer reports pursuant to this Rule 700.3 must include a description of the Potential Non-Eligibility and/or Reportable Activity, including the basis for the report, in reasonably sufficient detail to enable Notabene to investigate, along with supporting documentation, if any. 

Note: Peer reports made in bad faith or with reckless disregard for the truth may subject the reporting Partner to enforcement action under this Part 7, including potential suspension. Notabene will determine whether a report was made in bad faith based on the totality of circumstances.

**Rule 701\. Enforcement Status.**

1\. Each Partner is assigned a status that is updated in real time to reflect that Partner’s compliance and performance with respect to the triggers in Rule 700\. A Partner’s status has potential enforcement consequences. 

2\. A Partner will receive notice that a status change has occurred. This notice will include the basis for this status change in reasonably sufficient detail.

3\. The status of each Partner will be fully transparent to every other Partner in the System. 

4\. Notwithstanding anything herein, Notabene disclaims any and all liability arising from (i) a Partner’s status or the information on which a status is based, including, but not limited to, any inaccuracy or incompleteness of such status or information and/or (ii) a Partner’s suspension from Notabene Flow. Such disclaimed liability encompasses both direct and indirect damages, including but not limited to loss of income and reputational damages. Partner assumes the sole and full risk of any and all damages that may arise from its participation in Notabene Flow.

4\. This Rule 701 cannot be revised, except by Notabene.

**Rule 702\. Verified Status (Green)**

“Verified” status (green) is every Partner’s default status upon joining the Network. A “verified” status can also result upon a successful reinstatement from other statuses, as provided below. 

**Rule 703\. Warning Status (Yellow)**

1\. A “warning” status (yellow) will be triggered if:

1) Transaction Fees for any transaction are up to seven (7) days past due,  
2) Any one KPI is exceeded for two consecutive months,   
3) A Partner does not respond for thirty (30) days to an Overdue Notice, or   
4) Notabene receives a peer report, or independently identifies, a Potential Non-Eligibility. 

**Rule 704\. Probation Status (Orange)**

1\. A “probation” status (orange) will be triggered if:

1) Transaction Fees for any transaction are more than fourteen (14) days past due,  
2) Transaction Fees are unpaid for two separate transactions,  
3) Any one KPI failure is unresolved for two additional consecutive months after the “warning” status goes into effect,  
4) Failures in three (3) KPI categories in one month,  
5) A Partner does not respond for sixty (60) days to an Overdue Notice ,  
6) An investigation determines that a Partner is not in compliance with the Eligibility Criteria, or  
7) Notabene receives a peer report identifying, or independently identifies, any Reportable Activity. 

**Rule 705\. Suspended Status (Red)**

A “suspended” status (red) will be triggered if:

1) Transaction Fees for any transaction are more than thirty (30) days past due,  
2) Transaction Fees are unpaid for three or more separate transactions,  
3) Any one KPI failure is unresolved for two additional consecutive months after the “probation” status goes into effect,  
4) Failures in four (4) or more KPI categories in one month,  
5) No response for ninety (90) days to an Overdue Notice,   
6) No cure within thirty (30) days of a determination of non-compliance with Eligibility Criteria, or  
7) An investigation determines that a Partner has undertaken any Reportable Activity. 

**Rule 706\. Status Consequences**

1\. A Partner with a “verified” status may fully participate in Notabene Flow. A Partner with a “warning” or “probation” status may fully participate in Notabene Flow, notwithstanding that an investigation may be ongoing. 

2\. A Partner with a “suspended” status is immediately suspended from Notabene Flow. The Partner is prohibited from conducting transactions and has no access to APIs or any systems, but remains obligated for all due Transaction Fees, restitution obligations, and contractual commitments. All in-flight transactions must be settled within 10 days of the date of suspension. The Partner must also cooperate with any ongoing investigation or audit.

**Rule 707\. Remediation**

1\. A Partner is immediately obligated and responsible to pay any and all Transaction Fees that it has been notified are due and owing to other Partners. If a Partner with a “warning” or “probation” status pays Transaction Fees in full to the other Partners that are due these fees, the first Partner’s status returns to “verified.” 

2\. The status of a Partner with a “warning” status due to an unattained KPI returns to “verified” at the end of a full calendar month in which this KPI is met. The status of a Partner with a “probation” status due to unattained KPI(s) returns to “verified” at the end of two (2) consecutive calendar months in which the KPI(s) is/are met.

3\. A Partner with a “warning” or “probation” status can cure any issue relating to Eligibility Criteria by submitting documentation to Notabene’s satisfaction. When Notabene accepts the required documentation, in its sole judgment, then that Partner’s status returns to “verified.”

4\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any new trigger occurs, the Partner’s status may change from “verified” on that basis.

5\. For Partners with “suspended” status, this Rule 707 does not apply. The only way to change a “suspended” status is via reinstatement under Rule 709\.

**Rule 708\. Investigation**

1\. Upon providing notice and changing a Partner’s status, Notabene will open an investigation if the basis for the status change is (i) an uncured Potential Non-Eligibility or (ii) a Reportable Activity. An opportunity to be heard is central to an investigation. Notabene will solicit, review, and consider statements from the reporting and reported Partners, as well as any documentation or records that these Partners provide or that Notabene independently deems relevant. At its sole discretion, Notabene may request additional information from these Partners or others. 

2\. Notabene will review and consider all information, and assign appropriate weight based on reliability and relevance. Notabene will make a determination based on the totality of information as to whether a Partner (i) is not compliant with Eligibility Criteria or (ii) has undertaken any Reportable Activity (depending on the basis of the investigation). 

3\. If the determination is that a Partner is in compliance or did not undertake a Reportable Activity, then the Partner’s status will revert to “verified.”  

4\. Upon a determination of non-compliance with Eligibility Criteria, a Partner’s status will change to “probation,” and if no cure is provided within 30 days, the status will change to “suspended.”

5\. Upon a determination that a Partner has undertaken a Reportable Activity, the Partner’s status will change to “suspended.”

**Rule 709\. Reinstatement**

1\. A Partner with a “suspended status” must satisfy the following requirements to be eligible for reinstatement to Notabene Flow with a “probation” status:

1) The Partner will be excluded from Notabene Flow for 4-12 months, with the decision of how many months at Notabene’s sole discretion. This suspension does not preclude Notabene pursuing any other available remedy, including, without limitation, termination of the Agreement.   
     
2) The Partner will cure the basis for its suspended status by, as applicable:   
     
   1. Paying all due and owed Transaction Fees;   
   2. Meeting the KPIs at issue for 4 consecutive months;   
   3. Submitting the Eligibility Criteria documentation and receiving Notabene’s approval;   
   4. For Reportable Activities, formulating and implementing a remediation plan and receiving Notabene’s approval to reinstate; and/or  
   5. For fraud, the Partner is additionally obligated and responsible to pay restitution to all harmed Partners (which will be included in the remediation plan).   
      

2\. Upon reinstatement, a Partner will maintain a "probation" status for a period equal to the length of time that the Partner was suspended. Any violation during probation may result in permanent suspension at Notabene's sole discretion. Peer reports of Reportable Activity during probation will be investigated pursuant to Rule 708 before any status change occurs. At the end of the probation period, the Partner's status will revert to "verified" if no violations occurred.

**Rule 710\. Collection and Restitution**

Partners may use legal means (external to Notabene Flow) to pursue collection of due and unpaid Transaction Fees or to seek restitution for harm caused by fraud. A Partner's status and/or Notabene’s determination upon investigation may be presented as evidence if a Partner elects to take legal action.

**APPENDIX**

**Dynamic Legislating System**

***This is suggested language only and is not in effect unless and until incorporated into the Rules pursuant to the requirements therein.*** 

**Rule 1\.** **Proposal Submission and Structure**

The Dynamic Legislating System (the “**System**”) contains the text of the most current version of the Rules which is in effect and governs the Network. 

Any Partner may propose revisions to an existing Rule by opening a Proposal in the System and inserting required information. This may include, for example, the rule or section number, the proposed replacement text, and the purpose of the Proposal.

Each Proposal must address only one Rule. Multiple proposed revisions to different Rules must be submitted as separate Proposals.

**Rule 2\. Review Period** 

Every Proposal is open in the System for a “**Review Period**” of 96 hours (excluding Saturdays and Sundays) from the time of submission.

If a Proposal’s Review Period is open and more Proposals are submitted on the same Rule, then this Review Period is extended to expire for all of these Proposals 48 hours after the last Proposal was submitted. No more than four Proposals on a single Rule are permitted in one Review Period.

During a Review Period, any Partner may post comments about a Proposal (or related Proposals on the same Rule) in a discussion that the System threads for readability. There may be multiple concurrent discussions, each organized around such Proposal(s).

**Rule 3\. Interest in a Proposal**

During the Review Period, in addition to any comments, a Partner may post one of the following commands on a Proposal (“**Commands**”):

**/approve** – Partner supports the Proposal;

**/abstain** – Partner is neutral but interested in the Proposal; and

**/block** – Partner objects to the Proposal.

At the close of a Proposal's Review Period (including any extensions), the System counts each posted Command and tallies them to evaluate the Proposal. “**Interest**” is calculated as the total of individual Commands posted (inclusive of all three Command types). “**Objections**” are the total number of /block Commands.

**Rule 4\. Automatic Outcomes**

A Proposal is considered if at least 10% of all registered Partners post a Command (/approve, /abstain, or /block) for this Proposal (“**Interest Threshold**”). A Proposal with less than the Interest Threshold at the close of the Review Period is automatically rejected for low interest. For a Proposal meeting the Interest Threshold at the close of the Review Period, the System determines whether at least 5% of all registered Partners posted /block for a Proposal (“**Objection Threshold**”). 

For a Proposal meeting the Interest Threshold: if Objections are below the Objection Threshold, the Proposal is adopted automatically and merged into the Rules; and if Objections are above the Objection Threshold, the Proposal goes to a vote.

Summary Table:

| Condition | Result | Label |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Interest \< Interest Threshold | Rejected for low interest | low-interest |
| Interest ≥ Interest Threshold  AND Objections \< Objection Threshold | Adopted automatically;  merged into Rules | auto-merged |
| Interest ≥ Interest Threshold  AND Objections ≥ Objection Threshold | Sent to Formal Vote | needs-vote |
|  |  |  |

**Rule 5\. Ballot Formation**

All Proposals determined to require a vote ('needs-vote' status) are held in a pending queue. Every Monday at 09:00 AM Eastern, the System creates a ballot containing all Proposals in the pending queue whose Review Periods closed during the prior week. The pending queue is then cleared for the next cycle.

Each ballot is open for voting for 96 hours (excluding Saturdays and Sundays).

**Rule 6\. Eligible Voters** 

All Consortium Members are eligible to vote, and each Member has one vote, which is cast by its duly authorized representative.

Notabene intends for all Partners to be eligible to vote when certain milestones are achieved.

Failing to vote on 3 consecutive ballots results in a two-week suspension of a Partner’s voting privilege.

**Rule 7\. Quorum**

A quorum for any ballot requires the participation of at least 25% of eligible voters. If a quorum is not met, all Proposals on the ballot are rejected.

**Rule 8\. Voting Threshold**

Each Proposal on a ballot is voted yes/no by each voter.

The voting threshold for all Proposals is 60%, and the System determines whether this threshold is met for each Proposal. 

The Rules may evolve to incorporate tiered thresholds based on the criticality of certain Rules for overall governance.

**Rule 9\. Voting Outcomes**

Proposals meeting the voting threshold are adopted and merged into the Rules. Proposals not meeting the voting threshold are rejected.

If multiple Proposals affecting the same Rule each meet the voting threshold, only the Proposal with the highest 'yes' vote (in a tie, the earlier Proposal submission) is adopted and merged into the Rules, and all other Proposals affecting that Rule are rejected.
